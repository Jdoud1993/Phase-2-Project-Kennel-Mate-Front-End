# Kennel Mate

## An application designed for animal shelters and their pups, kittys, and others.

### Description:

This application has the ability to project your shelters information. If you have multiple shelters connected in any way be it a non-profit or a county then multiple shelters can be displayed. It also has the ability to present a running list of all the animals within your organization that can be deleted or added using our delete button or add animal form.

### Project Info:

This React.js project is feuled by a JSON server back end that can be found [Here](https://github.com/Jdoud1993/Phase-2-Project-Kennel-Mate-Back-End.git).

### Setup:

#### Back-End:
First you will need to fork and clone the backend for this project. After the repository is cloned you must navigate inside your terminal and into the file and enter the following: `npm run server`. This will allow the back end to start running and you should see a notification in the terminal saying that your server is running.

#### Front-End:
For the Front-End please fork and clone this project down to your environment. Once cloned move down into this
file within your terminal and enter the following: `npm start`, which will launch the browser view of the application.

### How to use this App:

This app has a home page that will be loaded with a bunch of information on how to fully use the app.
The main way to use this app is to navigate the different tabs and pages of this SPA using the buttons
across the top of the page. The bright red button will be the current page you are on. There should also
be a bit of information on each page letting you know what each page is for. Biggest thing with this app
is to have fun!
